I want to develop a spiking neural network model with brian2.

The network will have spike oscillation continuously.

The connectivity of the network should be set randomly using and adjacency matrix.

External input will be applied initially for a short period of time, then it will be ceased.

The network will continue firing after external stimuli is cut.

The synapses will not be changed during the simulation.

Implelement this simulation in python using brian2.
